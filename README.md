# DotFiles
This project is meant to contain my current Linux Desktop setup, by providing portability to my dotFiles I will be able to switch machines
without too much hassle. It also may come in handy if the OS crashes horribly.
## How to Use
- Installing 'GNU Stow' (sudo apt install Stow)
- Cloning this repository into the home directory a.k.a '~'
- stow 'whateverYouWant' will copy that to ~/.config/whateverYouWant
- stow */ to copy everything into ~/.config/
- Obviously using this repository to make changes to the dotFiles so there is a record of the code
## Instructions to add further dotFiles
- mkdir nameOfTheProgram && cd nameOfTheProgram
- mkdir .config && cd .config
- mkdir nameOfTheProgram && cd nameOfTheProgram
- Put the dotFile here
