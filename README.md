# DotFiles
This project is meant to provide portability to my dotFiles so it's possible to change machine
without too much hassle.
It will contain my current Linux Desktop setup.
## How to Use
- Installing 'GNU Stow' (sudo apt install Stow)
- Cloning this repository into the home directory a.k.a '~'
- stow 'whateverYouWant' will copy that to ~/.config/whateverYouWant
- stow */ to copy everything into ~/.config/
- Obviously using this repository to make changes to the dotFiles so there is a record of the code
